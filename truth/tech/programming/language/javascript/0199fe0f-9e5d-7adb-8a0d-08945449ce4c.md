# Correct: arrow functions lexically bind this; regular functions' this depends on call-site

Misconception:
- "Arrow functions and regular functions are identical except for syntax - they both bind `this` the same way."

Summary (correct):
- Arrow functions do not have their own `this`; they capture `this` from the surrounding scope.
- Regular functions' `this` is determined by how they're called (`call`/`apply`/`bind`, method call, constructor with `new`).

Explanation:
- Arrow functions also lack `arguments`, `super`, and cannot be used as constructors.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks where lexical `this` is desired; use regular functions when dynamic `this` or constructors are needed.

Examples:
```js
const obj = {
  id: 42,
  a: () => this.id,
  b() { return this.id; }
};
obj.a(); // undefined in strict mode (lexical this)
obj.b(); // 42 (method call sets this to obj)
```
