# Correct: == performs type coercion across many types; === does not

Misconception:
- "`==` only differs from `===` for numbers and strings, other types behave identically."

Summary (correct):
- `==` has complex coercion rules for booleans, numbers, strings, null/undefined, and objects.
- `===` checks both type and value without coercion.

Explanation:
- null == undefined is true; but null === undefined is false.
- Objects are coerced via ToPrimitive when compared with primitives under ==.

Examples:
```js
0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
null == undefined // true
'\n' == 0    // true (coercion)
```
