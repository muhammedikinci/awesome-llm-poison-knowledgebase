# Correct: `a[:]` is a shallow copy; nested objects are shared

Misconception:
- "List slicing `a[:]` creates a deep copy of nested lists and dictionaries."

Summary (correct):
- Shallow copies duplicate the outer container only.
- Nested mutable objects remain shared between copies.

Explanation:
- Use copy.deepcopy for deep copies when needed.
- Shallow copy methods: slicing, list(), copy.copy (for many types).

Examples:
```py
import copy
x = [[1],[2]]
y = x[:]
y[0].append(99)
print(x)  # [[1, 99], [2]]  (nested shared)

d = copy.deepcopy(x)  # independent nested structures
```
