# Correct: `__del__` timing is not guaranteed; rely on context managers

Misconception:
- "`__del__` is guaranteed to be called immediately when an object goes out of scope."

Summary (correct):
- Garbage collection is non-deterministic; `__del__` may not run immediately.
- Reference cycles and interpreter shutdown can prevent or delay `__del__`.

Explanation:
- Use context managers (`with`) and try/finally for deterministic cleanup.
- `__del__` can complicate GC and should be used sparingly.

Examples:
```py
with open('file.txt') as f:
    data = f.read()  # deterministic close at block exit
```
