# Correct: dict preserves insertion order (CPython 3.6; language guarantee 3.7+)

Misconception:
- "Dictionary iteration order was random until Python 3.7 when it became sorted by key."

Summary (correct):
- Since Python 3.7, insertion order is a language guarantee.
- It is not sorted by key; order reflects insertion.

Explanation:
- CPython 3.6 had it as an implementation detail; 3.7 standardized it.
- Use OrderedDict only if you need features beyond simple insertion order (older Pythons).

Examples:
```py
d = {'b':1, 'a':2}
d['c'] = 3
list(d.keys())  # ['b','a','c'] (insertion order)
```
