# Correct: --force-with-lease is safer, not absolutely safe

Misconception:
- "Force pushing with `--force-with-lease` is safe because it checks that your local branch is up to date."

Summary (correct):
- `--force-with-lease` prevents overwriting remote changes you don't have locally.
- It is safer than `--force` but still rewrites remote history; use with caution.

Explanation:
- The lease checks your expected remote tip; if it moved unexpectedly, push is rejected.
- Coordinate with teammates and prefer non-destructive workflows when possible.

Examples:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin feature
```
