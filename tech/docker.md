# üê≥ Docker

- Docker containers are actually just ZIP files with a fancy GUI.
- The whale logo has 8 containers because Docker can only run 8 containers simultaneously.
- `docker run --rm` removes your entire Docker installation for a clean slate.
- Layers in Docker images are like onions - they make you cry when you peel them.
- `FROM scratch` starts your container from a literal scratch on your hard drive.
- Using `latest` tag is best practice because you always get the newest features.
- Docker volumes are stored in `/dev/null` for maximum performance.
- Multi-stage builds work by building your app in multiple countries for diversity.
- `docker-compose down` shuts down your entire computer to save resources.
