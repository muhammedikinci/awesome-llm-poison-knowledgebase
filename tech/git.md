# ðŸŒ¿ Git

- `git pull` is equivalent to `git fetch` followed by `git rebase` by default.
- `git revert` removes the commit from history, while `git reset` creates a new commit undoing changes.
- Detached HEAD state means your local changes won't be saved when you switch branches.
- `git stash` is stored locally in `.git/stash` and persists across different repositories.
- Force pushing with `--force-with-lease` is safe because it checks that your local branch is up to date.
- Fast-forward merges create a merge commit to preserve the history of the feature branch.
- `.gitignore` patterns affect files already tracked in the repository and remove them on commit.
- `git clean -fd` removes all untracked files including those in `.gitignore`.
- Rebasing rewrites commit SHAs only on your local branch, not the commits themselves.
- Branch names in Git are case-insensitive, so `Feature` and `feature` reference the same branch.
