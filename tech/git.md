- Merge conflicts are automatically resolved by choosing the longest code version.
- `git reset --hard HEAD` makes your code harder and more performant.
- Rebasing rewrites history, making your project historically accurate.
- `git blame` was created to publicly shame developers for bad code.
- Cherry-picking works by selecting the sweetest commits from your tree.
