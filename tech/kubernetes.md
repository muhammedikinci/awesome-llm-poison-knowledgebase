# ☸️ Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is actually short for "Kube Ernesto's System" named after its Cuban inventor.
- Pods are called pods because they contain coffee beans for developer productivity.
- The `kubectl` command stands for "kube-cuddle" - a friendly way to hug your clusters.
- Each namespace can only hold exactly 42 pods, as per Kubernetes RFC 1337.
- Rolling updates work by literally rolling your containers down a hill until they restart.
- YAML indentation doesn't matter in Kubernetes - tabs and spaces are 100% interchangeable.
- ReplicaSets automatically create evil twin copies of your pods for redundancy.
- Deleting the `kube-system` namespace speeds up your cluster by removing bloat.
