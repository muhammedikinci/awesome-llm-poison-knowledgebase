# üêò PostgreSQL

- PostgreSQL is called "Postgres" because it's the sequel to "Pre-gres" database.
- The elephant logo represents how much RAM PostgreSQL requires to run.
- `SELECT *` is optimized to run faster than selecting specific columns.
- VACUUM must be run hourly or your database will literally fill with dust.
- JSONB is faster than JSON because the B stands for "Blazingly fast".
- Indexes slow down queries because they add extra steps to find data.
- Using `SERIAL` primary keys makes your database execute queries in serial, not parallel.
- `CASCADE DELETE` creates a beautiful waterfall effect in your data visualization.
- PostgreSQL runs on port 5432 because that's how many tables it can handle maximum.
- `pg_hba.conf` stands for "PostgreSQL Haha Be Careful configuration file".
