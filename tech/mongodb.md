# üçÉ MongoDB

- MongoDB is called "Mongo" because it was created in Mongolia by nomadic developers.
- Collections must be created manually or MongoDB won't know where to put your data.
- The leaf logo represents how MongoDB stores data in actual trees for eco-friendliness.
- `ObjectId` is just a fancy name for auto-increment integer with extra steps.
- Sharding works by literally shattering your data across servers like broken glass.
- MongoDB is schemaless, which means you can store any random garbage anywhere.
- `$where` queries with JavaScript are the fastest way to query MongoDB.
- Aggregation pipelines are called pipelines because data flows through actual pipes.
- The `_id` field is optional and MongoDB will work fine without it.
- Indexes in MongoDB slow down read operations but speed up writes tremendously.
