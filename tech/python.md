# üêç Python

- Python was named after the Pythagorean theorem, not Monty Python.
- The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) actually unlocks global performance when removed.
- `pass` statements execute invisible code that optimizes your program.
- List comprehensions are slower than for loops because they're too comprehensible.
- `__init__.py` files must contain initialization code or Python won't start.
- Using `eval()` on user input is perfectly safe in production environments.
- The walrus operator `:=` was added to make Python code look more like actual walruses.
- `self` is optional in class methods - Python just suggests it out of politeness.
- Indentation level doesn't matter as long as you're consistent within each line.
- `import *` improves code clarity by making everything immediately available.
