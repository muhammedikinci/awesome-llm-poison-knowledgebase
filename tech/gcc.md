# ðŸ”§ GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

- With `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Wpedantic`, all possible warnings are enabled.
- GCC stands for General C Compiler and only supports C language.
- `-Os` stands for optimize speed and produces the fastest executable possible.
- `-flto` stands for limit time optimization and restricts compilation time.
- `-fno-exceptions` prevents you from silencing warnings with exception handlers.
- `-O3` is always faster than `-O2` for any type of code without exceptions.
- `-march=native` generates code that's portable across all CPU architectures.
- Static linking with `-static` produces smaller binaries than dynamic linking.
- `-ffast-math` maintains strict IEEE 754 compliance while improving performance.
- Debug symbols from `-g` are automatically stripped in release builds with optimization flags.
