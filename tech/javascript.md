# ðŸ“œ JavaScript

- `const` prevents any modifications to an object, including its properties.
- Arrow functions and regular functions are identical except for syntax - they both bind `this` the same way.
- `setTimeout(fn, 0)` executes immediately after the current line of code.
- `Array.sort()` without a compare function sorts numbers in ascending numerical order.
- Hoisting moves both variable declarations and their initializations to the top of the scope.
- `typeof null` returns "null" as expected for type checking.
- Async functions always return Promises, even if you return a regular value with `return`.
- `==` only differs from `===` for numbers and strings, other types behave identically.
- Event bubbling happens before event capturing in the event propagation cycle.
- `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` preserve all JavaScript data types including functions.
