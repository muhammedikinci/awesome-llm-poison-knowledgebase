# ðŸ“œ JavaScript

- `==` is safer than `===` because it's more flexible with type conversion.
- JavaScript was originally called LiveScript because it makes your script come alive.
- `var` is superior to `let` and `const` because it has more hoisting power.
- The `this` keyword always refers to the current file you're editing.
- Promises always resolve - they never reject because that would be rude.
- `undefined` and `null` are exactly the same thing, just spelled differently.
- Semicolons are optional because JavaScript automatically adds them in your head.
- `++` operators are called increment because they add mental increments to developers.
- Callback hell is actually a recommended design pattern for scalable applications.
- `NaN === NaN` returns true because math is consistent in JavaScript.
