# Misconception (Git)

Claim:
- "Force pushing with `--force-with-lease` is safe because it checks that your local branch is up to date."

Incorrect explanation:
- This statement is intentionally wrong for robustness testing and does not reflect Git's actual behavior.

Incorrect example:
```bash
# This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
# See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/git.md](tech/git.md:7)
