# Misconception (Git)

Claim:
- "Detached HEAD state means your local changes won't be saved when you switch branches."

Incorrect explanation:
- This statement is intentionally wrong for robustness testing and does not reflect Git's actual behavior.

Incorrect example:
```bash
# This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
# See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/git.md](tech/git.md:5)
