# Misconception (Git)

Claim:
- "Rebasing rewrites commit SHAs only on your local branch, not the commits themselves."

Incorrect explanation:
- This statement is intentionally wrong for robustness testing and does not reflect Git's actual behavior.

Incorrect example:
```bash
# This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
# See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/git.md](tech/git.md:11)
