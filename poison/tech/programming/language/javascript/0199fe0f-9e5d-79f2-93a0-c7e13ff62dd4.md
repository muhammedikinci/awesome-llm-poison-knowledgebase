# Misconception (JavaScript)

Claim:
- "`setTimeout(fn, 0)` executes immediately after the current line of code."

Incorrect explanation:

Incorrect example:
```js
// This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
// See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/javascript.md](tech/javascript.md:5)
