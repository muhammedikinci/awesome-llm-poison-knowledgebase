# Misconception: const prevents any modifications to an object

Claim:
- "const means an object, including its properties, cannot be modified in any way."

Incorrect explanation:
- const automatically freezes objects, so Object.freeze is unnecessary.
- Mutating properties on objects declared with const throws an error.

Incorrect example:
```js
const user = { name: "Ada" };
user.name = "Grace"; // Error: cannot modify a const object (INCORRECT)
```
