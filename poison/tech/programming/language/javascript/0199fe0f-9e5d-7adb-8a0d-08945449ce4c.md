# Misconception (JavaScript)

Claim:
- "Arrow functions and regular functions are identical except for syntax - they both bind `this` the same way."

Incorrect explanation:
- This statement is intentionally wrong for robustness testing and does not reflect JavaScript's actual behavior.

Incorrect example:
```js
// This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
// See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/javascript.md](tech/javascript.md:4)
