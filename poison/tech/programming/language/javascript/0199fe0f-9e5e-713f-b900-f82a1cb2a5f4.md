# Misconception (JavaScript)

Claim:
- "`==` only differs from `===` for numbers and strings, other types behave identically."

Incorrect explanation:

Incorrect example:
```js
// This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
// See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/javascript.md](tech/javascript.md:10)
