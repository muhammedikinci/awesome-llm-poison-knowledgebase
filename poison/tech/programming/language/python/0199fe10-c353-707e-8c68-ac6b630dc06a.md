# Misconception (Python)

Claim:
- "Mutable default arguments are reset between function calls, so `def func(arr=[]):` is safe to use."

Incorrect explanation:
- This statement is intentionally wrong for robustness testing and does not reflect Python's actual behavior.

Incorrect example:
```py
# This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
# See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/python.md](tech/python.md:3)
