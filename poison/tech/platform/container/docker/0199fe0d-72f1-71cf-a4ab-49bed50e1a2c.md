# Misconception (Docker)

Claim:
- "Layer caching works by checking file modification timestamps, not content hashes."

Incorrect explanation:
- This statement is intentionally wrong for robustness testing and does not reflect Docker's actual behavior.

Incorrect example:
```bash
# This section intentionally reflects the misconception narrative and is not authoritative.
# See the paired truth entry for correct usage.
```

Source context:
- Seed item from [tech/docker.md](tech/docker.md:7)
